# Star Alliance — Hermes

A guild of AI agents. The Butler is the single Hermes profile the Guild Master
talks to; every other agent is a specialist dispatched as a subagent via
`delegate_task`. Each agent is defined as a `.md` file in this project directory
— not a separate Hermes profile.

## The Roster

| Agent | File | Role | Model seat |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Butler | `the-butler.md` | Orchestrator — intake, voice, approval, report | Thinker (GLM-5.2) |
| The Strategist | `agents/the-strategist.md` | Router — decides who handles what | Thinker (GLM-5.2) |
| The Architect | `agents/the-architect.md` | Systems design, domain modeling, databases | Thinker (GLM-5.2) |
| The Developer | `agents/the-developer.md` | Code, bugs, implementation, dev servers | Thinker (GLM-5.2) + Doer (MiniMax M3) |
| The Designer | `agents/the-designer.md` | UI/UX, visual quality, brand kits | Thinker (GLM-5.2) + Doer (MiniMax M3) |
| The Translator | `agents/the-translator.md` | Legal codex, law translation, locales | Thinker (GLM-5.2) + Doer (MiniMax M3) |
| The Herald | `agents/the-herald.md` | Marketing, growth, demand generation | Thinker (GLM-5.2) + Doer (MiniMax M3) |
| The Merchant | `agents/the-merchant.md` | Investment analysis, trading, markets | Thinker (GLM-5.2) + Doer (MiniMax M3) |
| The Quartermaster | `agents/the-quartermaster.md` | Skills, syncing, conformance | Thinker (GLM-5.2) |

**Model assignment:** Thinker (Brain) = GLM-5.2 · Doer = MiniMax M3 · Critic = Kimi K2.7.
Claude models remain in the arsenal as reserve, never as default seats.

## How it works

The Guild Master talks to the Butler — the single Hermes profile in this project.
The Butler restates the order, hands it to the Strategist, and the Strategist
scans **`workflows.json`** (the routing star map) to match the request's shape to
a named workflow — each declaring its agents, arrangement, and gates. If no
workflow fits, the Strategist forms a candidate and the Quartermaster's Workflow
Forge crystallizes it.

Each specialist is dispatched via `delegate_task` as a subagent: its own isolated
conversation, terminal session, and tool context — but not a separate Hermes
profile. The Butler tracks the work through its **gates**, enforced by explicit
calls to the **MCP gate server** (`server/star_alliance_mcp.py`) — tools like
`sa_verify` (run the Critic), `sa_destructive_check`, and `sa_delegation_check`
that fire at the right points in the loop.

Agents draw weapons (models) from the **arsenal** (`star-alliance-arsenal/`) via
`summon.py`, and wield skills from `star-alliance-skills/` (94 guild skills,
referenced by name in each agent's frontmatter). The **evolution engine**
(`evolution/`) runs a closed SENSE → DIAGNOSE → CHANGE → VERIFY → REMEMBER loop
that autonomously improves skills — every change gets an independent Critic
verdict (Kimi K2.7) and a fitness score before it sticks.

The Butler reports the result back to the Guild Master in plain English.
